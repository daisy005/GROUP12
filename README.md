## Sprint 0:
### To do:
* Decide on **timing**
* Decide on the type of **project**

<br />
<br />


### Project:

We decided on our project by:
 * brainstorming and writing down our ideas,
 * discussing pros and cons of choosing each,
 * and finally voting on our favourites (using ranked voting).

<br />


### Definition of done:

1. Java Code	is written, it compiles and runs	
2. JUnit Tests are written for the feature, and all the tests are passed	
3. The goal of the User Story is met
4. Description of the new developments is added to the readme file and pivital tracker is updated

<br />

### User stories:

### Planning poker
We assigned story points to our user stories using planning poker:

#### Retrospective conclusions:
 * We underestimated the time it would take for setting up the build.gradle for testing
 * Hence we were unable to fulfil our DoD for all of our stories even though most of the code was written
 * All of our stories depend on our ability to save persisting data has proven to be more challenging than we had anticipated
 * Our user story "Main Page #1" was poorly written and therefore we were unable to test it going forward, we want to revise all our user stories and change those that aren't testable
 * In regards to scrum meetings, we have found the in-real-life meetings to be more productive than the WhatsApp meetings but also more draining on our team due to them running over time
 * Going forward we will try to implement more shorter segment in real life meetings in order to be more productive without burning out the team
