# Sprint Retrospective 

## Sprint Retrospective Outcome

_After the first development sprint discuss and agree in a short meeting one thing that you'll do differently in the next sprint. This must be something that will have a demonstrable, positive impact on how well you complete stories in the next sprint. You will need to reflect on how well you did this and provide evidence so pick something concrete (i.e. not abstract like "work harder") for which it is possible to show evidence. Do not choose communication. While improving this is usually helpful in previous years most groups choose this but then can't provide evidence of improving it._


## Reflection on how successful you were at implementing this change

(100-300 words)

_Reflect on how well you did the thing you said you would. Provide evidence (if you like you can add files into the same folder as this document mention them here). Reflect on whether this had the impact you hoped for. If so, provide evidence._
